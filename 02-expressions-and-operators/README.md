# 🔢 Expressions & Operators

This folder contains my second Python mini challenge from the IBM Data Science course.

## 💪 Challenge:
- Use expressions to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle using `width` and `height` variables.

## 📄 My Code:
I calculated:
- 🟦 Area = width × height
- 📏 Perimeter = 2 × (width + height)

## ✅ Output Example:
📐 Area of the rectangle is: 21 📏 Perimeter of the rectangle is: 20

> Practicing expressions helped me understand how Python handles math operations and variable usage.
