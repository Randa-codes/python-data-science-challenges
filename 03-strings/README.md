# âœ¨ Strings & String Methods

This folder contains my mini challenge where I practiced string slicing, case conversion, and counting letters.

## ðŸ’ª Challenge:
- Write a favorite quote
- Slice the first 10 characters and convert them to uppercase
- Count how many times the letter `'t'` appears in the quote

## âœ… Output Example:
ðŸ§  First 10 letters (uppercase): WE CANNOT ðŸ”¢ Number of 't's in the quote: 6

> This helped me practice slicing and using string methods like `.upper()` and `.count()`
