# 🔁 Conditionals & Branching

This folder contains a mini challenge where I ask the user to input a number and determine whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

## 💪 Challenge:
- Use `input()` to get a number from the user
- Check its value using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Display the result with a clear message

## ✅ Output Example:
Enter a number of your choice: -5 ❌ The number is negative.

> This challenge helped me understand branching logic and how Python reacts to different conditions.
