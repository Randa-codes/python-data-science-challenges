# 🔁 Loops (for, while)

This folder contains several variations of loop challenges from the IBM Python for Data Science course.

## 💪 Challenges Included:

- Print even numbers from 1 to 20 (using `if i % 2 == 0`)
- Print even numbers from 0 to 20 (using step in `range`)
- Countdown from 10 to 1 using a `while` loop
- Print odd numbers from 1 to 19 (using both `range(..., 2)` and `i % 2 != 0`)

## ✅ Sample Output:
🟦 Even numbers from 1 to 20 (using modulo): 2 4 6 ...

🔻 Countdown from 10 to 1 (using while loop): 10 9 8 ...

> These challenges helped reinforce different ways to control loops in Python.
