# ðŸ“¦ Data Structures â€“ Dictionaries

This folder contains a mini challenge where I created a dictionary of products and their prices.

## ðŸ’ª Challenge:
- Create a dictionary with at least 5 items
- Print only the products with a price higher than 1000 DZD

## âœ… Output Example:
ðŸ›’ Products costing more than 1000 DZD:

car

coffee machine

television

> This helped me practice using `.items()` to loop through key-value pairs and apply filters.
