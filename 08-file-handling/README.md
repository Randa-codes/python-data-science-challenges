# 📁 File Handling

This folder contains a mini challenge where I practiced writing to and reading from text files.

## 💪 Challenge:
- Write a list of favorite foods to a file
- Read the file using:
  - `.read()` to display full content
  - Line-by-line loop with `.strip()` to clean each line

## ✅ Output Example:
📖 Reading full file with .read(): Pizza Couscous Sushi ...

📄 Reading file line by line with .strip(): 🍽️ Pizza 🍽️ Couscous ...

> This helped me understand how Python handles files for reading and writing.
