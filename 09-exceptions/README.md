# 🚨 Exception Handling

This folder contains a mini challenge where I practiced safe user input and arithmetic using `try`, `except`, and `finally`.

## 💪 Challenge:
- Ask user for two numbers
- Divide them and show result
- Handle errors:
  - Division by zero → `ZeroDivisionError`
  - Invalid input → `ValueError`

## ✅ Sample Output:
🔢 Enter number 2: 0
❌ You cannot divide by zero.
🏁 Challenge done.

> This helped me write safer Python code and understand runtime error handling.
