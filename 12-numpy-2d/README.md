# 🧮 NumPy – 2D Arrays

This folder contains a mini challenge where I worked with 2D arrays (matrices) using NumPy.

## 💪 Challenge:
- Create two 3×3 matrices
- Slice the first row of the first matrix
- Add the two matrices
- Multiply the first matrix by 2
- Calculate the dot product of both matrices
- Transpose the first matrix

## ✅ Output Example:
🔍 First row of X: [1 2 3]
🧮 X + Y: [[11 13 15], ...]
✖️ X * 2: [[2 4 6], ...]
📌 Dot Product: [[...]]
🔄 Transpose of X: [[1 4 7], ...]

> This helped me practice slicing, vectorized math, and matrix operations.
