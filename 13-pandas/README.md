# ðŸ“Š Pandas â€“ DataFrame, CSV & Filtering

This folder contains a mini challenge where I worked with Pandas to:
- Create and save a CSV file
- Load it into a DataFrame
- Calculate total value of products
- Filter items with a total value above 1000 DZD

## âœ… Output Example:
ðŸ“¦ Items loaded from CSV: Names Prices Quantities 0 coffee machine 5000 1 1 chair 500 10 ...

ðŸ’° Items with Total Value > 1000 DZD: Names Prices Quantities Total Value 0 coffee machine 5000 1 5000 1 chair 500 10 5000 ..

> This helped me practice CSV operations, column creation, and value filtering with Pandas.
