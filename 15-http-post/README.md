# ðŸ“¬ HTTP POST Request â€“ Form Data Challenge

This folder contains a mini challenge where I sent form data to a server using a POST request.

## ðŸ’ª Challenge:
- Send a POST request to `https://httpbin.org/post`
- Include form fields:
  - `name: Lisa`
  - `favorite_color: Blue`
- Print the full server response

## ðŸš€ Stretch Goal:
- Extract and print only the `form` part of the JSON response (the data I sent)

## âœ… Output Example:
ðŸ“¡ Full Response JSON: { "form": { "name": "Lisa", "favorite_color": "Blue" }, ... }

ðŸŽ¯ Data we sent (from 'form'): {'name': 'Lisa', 'favorite_color': 'Blue'}

> This helped me learn how to send form data to an API and read specific parts of the server response.
