# 🌐 Web Scraping – Quotes Challenge

This mini challenge scrapes inspirational quotes and their authors from [quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com) using BeautifulSoup and `requests`.

## 💪 Challenge:
- Send a GET request to the site
- Extract all quotes on the first page
- Print each quote with its author

## ✅ Output Example:

📝 “The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking...” ---> 💬 Albert Einstein
📝 “It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are...” ---> 💬 J.K. Rowling
...

> This helped me practice real-world web scraping with HTML tag filtering and data extraction.
